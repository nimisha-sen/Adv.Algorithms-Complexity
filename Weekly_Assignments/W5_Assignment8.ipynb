    "**Implementing a Simulated Annealing algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**\n",
    "- This problem is NP-hard, meaning that there is no known polynomial-time algorithm to solve it optimally in the general case.\n",
    "- Simulated Annealing is a probabilistic optimization algorithm inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy.\n",
    "- The algorithm starts with a high \"temperature\" that allows for a higher probability of accepting worse solutions. As the temperature decreases, the algorithm becomes more selective and tends to converge toward an optimal or near-optimal solution.\n",
    "- The rationale behind using Simulated Annealing for the TSP lies in its ability to escape local optima, explore a broad solution space, and eventually converge to a good solution.\n",
    "- It is particularly useful for problems with a large solution space where exploring every possible solution is impractical.\n",
    "- Difference with Genetic algorithm:\n",
    "    - While both are metaheuristic approaches for optimization, they have distinct mechanisms.\n",
    "    - Simulated Annealing operates with a single solution, exploring the solution space by probabilistically accepting worse solutions, while Genetic Algorithms maintain a population of solutions, evolving them through generations with crossover and mutation for global exploration. "
