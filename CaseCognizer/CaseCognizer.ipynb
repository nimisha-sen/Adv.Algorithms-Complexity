    "\n",
    "- CSV File Processing:\n",
    "    - The program successfully opens the initial CSV file (notsorted_excel_legal.csv) and the sorted CSV file (LegalDocs_sorted_by_len.csv).\n",
    "    - It prints the total number of rows and the field names for each file.\n",
    "- Job Sequencing:\n",
    "    - The program applies a job sequencing algorithm to select jobs with a deadline of 3 days or less. It prints the selected jobs and rejected jobs based on their deadlines.\n",
    "- Word Processing:\n",
    "    - The program counts the occurrences of specific words in the selected jobs.\n",
    "    - Word count for Job 1 - ('exp exp exp biotech biotech biotech biotech'): biotech: 4 instances\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Next Steps:\n",
    "- File Format Flexibility:\n",
    "    Implement functionality to handle different file formats, such as xml. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Graphical Representation:\n",
    "    Utilize a data visualization library like Matplotlib or Seaborn to create graphical representations of relevant data. This could include visualizing word occurrences, job deadlines, or other key metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sentiment Analysis:\n",
    "    Integrate an NLP library (e.g., spaCy, NLTK) or pre-trained models for sentiment analysis. Analyzing the sentiment of legal documents can provide valuable insights into the tone and context of the content.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Machine Learning for Relevance Ranking:**\n",
    "    Consider implementing machine learning models for relevance ranking. Train a model on labeled data to predict the relevance of legal documents to specific research topics. This could involve features like word frequency, sentiment, or document structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "- User Interface:\n",
    "    Develop a user-friendly interface to interact with your program. This could be a web-based dashboard or a desktop application. A well-designed interface will make it easier to input data, visualize results, and interpret findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Documentation and Testing:\n",
    "   Keep on adding and brainstorming algorithms that can be effectively be used. Implement comprehensive testing to catch bugs and validate the correctness of the algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Collaboration and Feedback:\n",
    "    Consider sharing your project with peers, mentors, or online communities to receive feedback. Collaborating with others can bring new perspectives and ideas, and feedback can help you refine and improve your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implementation of AI Models:\n",
    "    Proceed with implementing AI models for sentiment analysis and explore other AI applications in the legal tech sector. This might involve natural language processing, machine learning, or even deep learning, depending on the complexity of the tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Continuous Improvement:\n",
    "    Keep refining and expanding the project based on feedback and with my evolving understanding of the domain. Stay informed about new technologies and advancements in legal tech and AI.\n"

    "    The job_sequencing function implements a greedy algorithm for job sequencing. The goal is to process the most important legal document first by maximizing the amount and minimizing the deadline. This algorithm sorts the jobs based on the length of the first column in descending order and then schedules them based on their deadlines.\n",

    "Word Processing Algorithm:\n",
    "    The code processes selected jobs and classifies how many times each word from the specified list (to_find_word_arr) appears in the first column of the job. It uses a simple word count algorithm, iterating through the words in the column and checking for matches with the specified words in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "CSV File Handling:\n",
    "    The code uses the csv module to read and write CSV files. It extracts field names, reads rows from a CSV file, sorts rows, and writes the sorted rows to a new CSV file.\n"
